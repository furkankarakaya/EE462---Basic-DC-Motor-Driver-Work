# EE462---Basic-DC-Motor-Driver-Work
In this project, DC Motor driver application is modeled in Simulink as three different versions. By modelling DC Motor with basic components, with electrical blocks and with electromechanical blocks, it is learnt how a DC Motor block is constructed and modified for the rated operation. Then, by analyzing these three models and comparing them, the characteristics of the DC motor are studied. In order to understand DC Motor behavior, critical graphs are obtained and investigated in this project. Lastly, the obtained results are studied and commented for each model.
